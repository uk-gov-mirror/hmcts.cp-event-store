# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, which follows the guidelines
on [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/). This project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [25.104.2] - 2026-09-14
### Changed
- Updated `microservice-framework` to 25.104.2, which carries `framework-libraries` 25.104.2 and its new `liquibase-postgres-compatibility` module. Nothing here consumes that module directly — the bump keeps the framework chain on the current release.

## [25.104.1] - 2026-09-11
### Changed
- Updated the parent `maven-framework-parent-pom` to 25.104.1 to take the changes from it
- Updated `microservice-framework` to 25.104.1

## [25.104.0] - 2026-09-07
First official (non-milestone) release of the Java 25 / WildFly 40 / Jakarta EE 11 line,
consolidating milestones `25.104.0-M1` to `25.104.0-M6`.

### Changed
- Upgraded to Java 25 / WildFly 40 / Jakarta EE 11 (25.104.x release line)
- Bumped parent `maven-framework-parent-pom` and `framework.version` (microservice-framework) to the released `25.104.0` — Java 25 / Jakarta EE 11 targeting (`java.major.version=25`, `enforcer.java.version.range=[25,)`), Jakarta EE 11 API set, WildFly `40.0.0.Final`, Weld 6, RESTEasy 7, Hibernate ORM 6, Apache Artemis `2.54.0` under the new `org.apache.artemis` groupId, `liquibase.version=5.0.3`, Jackson `2.21.5` (**CVE-2026-54515**), the `org.junit:junit-bom` import, and the relocated `persistence-jpa` module carrying the event-stream self-healing `EntityManagerFlushInterceptor`
- Attached the ByteBuddy agent explicitly for tests: a `maven-dependency-plugin` `properties` execution at `initialize` resolves the agent path, and surefire's `argLine` gains `-javaagent:${net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy-agent:jar}`. Mockito's inline mock maker can no longer self-attach on modern JDKs, so without this the agent is loaded dynamically and warns (and will eventually fail)
- Added root-level `byte-buddy-agent` and `mockito-junit-jupiter` test dependencies
- Set `<skip>true</skip>` on `coveralls-maven-plugin`, and overrode its classpath to `jakarta.xml.bind-api` `2.3.2` — `coveralls-maven-plugin:4.3.0` ships with `2.3.1`, which is unavailable in the CI repository

### Removed
- `liquibase.hub.mode` property — removed in Liquibase 4.12.0, and any JAR bundling 4.12.0 or later rejects it under strict checking, causing the Kubernetes pre-install Liquibase job to time out
- `junit4.version` (`4.13.2`) property, which carried a "needed for deltaspike tests, should be moved to common bom" note — the DeltaSpike JUnit 4 tests are gone, so the property has no remaining users
- Local `jakarta.xml.bind-api.raml.version` property — the value (`2.3.2`) now comes from `maven-framework-parent-pom`, which centralised it so child projects could drop their copies

### Added
- **Fail-fast guard for the event-stream self-healing `EntityManagerFlushInterceptor`** (`subscription-manager`,
  `EntityManagerFlushInterceptorPresenceVerifier`, a CDI `Extension` running at `AfterDeploymentValidation`).
  When event-stream self-healing is enabled, it verifies the `EntityManagerFlushInterceptor` is present on every
  event-listener interceptor chain (the standard `EVENT_LISTENER` and any custom `*_EVENT_LISTENER` component) and
  **fails the deployment** (`addDeploymentProblem`) with a plain-English message if it is missing.
  **Why:** the flush interceptor forces each event-listener's DB changes to flush *within* the handler, so a DB
  error is caught by self-healing, recorded in the error tables, and retried; without it the error only fires at
  container commit — invisible to self-healing — and failing events are silently dropped. It had been accidentally
  dropped more than once (a persistence dependency reworked off the classpath; a custom event-listener component
  building its own chain), with no visible symptom until error capture was needed. The interceptor is matched by
  fully-qualified **class name**, so the check still runs (and fails) even when the module providing it has been
  dropped from the deployment. The check is gated on `isEventStreamSelfHealingEnabled()`: with self-healing off,
  the interceptor is intentionally absent and no verification runs.

### Fixed
- Removed `liquibase.searchPath: CLI` from `event-buffer-liquibase/liquibase.properties` — Liquibase 5.x treats `CLI` as a literal directory path (which doesn't exist), causing `FileNotFoundException` at startup; the embedded classpath changelog does not require an explicit search path
- `FrameworkTestDataSourceFactoryTest`: replaced `getCatalogs()` (returns a `ResultSet` of all catalog names) with `getCatalog()` (returns the current catalog name as a `String`) — the `getCatalogs()` return type is incompatible with `assertThat(..., is("frameworkeventstore"))` under Java 25 / H2 2.x
- Removed the explicit `${liquibase.version}` plugin version from 9 submodule poms, so the parent's `pluginManagement` takes effect

## [21.0.0-M1] - 2026-06-02
### Changed
- Upgraded to Java 21 and Jakarta EE 10 (17.104.x release line)
- Migrated aggregate service, snapshot service, and event source components from `javax.*` to `jakarta.*` namespaces (`SnapshotJdbcRepository`, `DefaultAggregateService`, `SnapshotAwareAggregateService`, `SnapshotAwareEventSourceProducer`, snapshot async observers)
- Removed `BaseTransactionalJunit4Test` helper class from `test-utils-persistence` — obsolete JUnit 4 utility superseded by `HibernateTestEntityManagerProvider`
- Removed `junit:junit` (JUnit 4) dependency from `test-utils-persistence/pom.xml`
- Replaced `javax:javaee-api` with `jakarta.platform:jakarta.jakartaee-api` in `test-utils-persistence/pom.xml`
- Removed `org.hibernate:hibernate-entitymanager` from `test-utils-persistence/pom.xml` — merged into `hibernate-core` in Hibernate 6
### Fixed
- Corrected wrong CDI scope annotation in `SubscriptionsDescriptorsRegistryProducer`: replaced `jakarta.faces.bean.ApplicationScoped` (JSF — functional bug) with `jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped`; also migrated remaining `javax.enterprise.inject.Produces` and `javax.inject.Inject` imports to Jakarta equivalents
- Migrated `javax.interceptor.Interceptors` and `javax.inject.Inject` imports to `jakarta.*` in `EventStoreVerificationCommandHandler`
- Migrated `javax.enterprise.*`, `javax.inject.Inject`, and `javax.interceptor.Interceptors` imports to `jakarta.*` in `CatchupObserver`
- Removed redundant `net.bytebuddy:byte-buddy-agent` version override from root `dependencyManagement` — already managed at `${byte-buddy.version}` in `cp-maven-common-bom`
- Updated `StreamErrorPersistenceTest`, `AdvisoryLockDataAccessTest`, `EventDiscoveryConfigTest`, `AccessControllerTest`, `ReplayEventToEventListenerProcessorBeanTest`, and `EventSubscriptionStatusRepositoryTest` to use Jakarta EE 10 APIs and Hibernate 6 compatible patterns

### [17.104.1]  - 2026-03-23
## Added
- Notification-based event linking and publishing via CDI events, enabled via JNDI:
  - event.linking.worker.notified (linking)
  - event.publishing.worker.notified (publishing)
- Bug fixes: dead notifier thread recovery, submit() failure handling
### Changed
- Batch event linking: `EventNumberLinker` now links N events per JTA transaction using JDBC `executeBatch()`,
  configurable via JNDI `event.linking.worker.batch.size` (default 10)

# [17.104.0] - 2025-12-16
### Added
- Added [framework E rollout and rollback SQLs document](event-sourcing/event-repository/event-repository-liquibase/docs/framework-E-sqls.md)
- Catchup can now be run with the id of the event you wish to run catchup from. Catchup
  will ignore events before this event and only catchup this event and events with higher
  event numbers. The event id should be sent to jmx using the `--commandRuntimeId` switch.
  If no eventId is sent then catchup will run from the first event as normal
- Re-introduced the event-number database sequence in case we need to roll back, in which case the
  sequence will be up to date
- Event publishing now also saves events into deprecated published_event table for compatibility with previous event publishing
- New JNDI value `event.publishing.add.event.to.published.event.table.on.publish` to control whether event is also inserted into published_event table. This value is true by default.
- New index on date_created in event_log
- New column `previous_event_number` on `event_log` table
- New column `is_published` on `event_log` table
- New index `idx_event_log_not_sequenced` on `event_log(date_created)`
